The goal of my project is to replicate the character creation portion of a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) by the name of Fantasy AGE (or FAGE).

This TTRPG like many others, has a multi step process for creating a character. Fantasy Age in particular requires 9 steps with mutliple choice at each step. This involves many decisions that create multiple dependencies, and this is where new players can have a difficult time. Many of the steps require the user to reference other sections of the book to view the options and descriptions. Sometimes, subsequent steps require the user to go back to sections already visited and either upgrade and existing choice, or choose an additional choice.

The entire process must be tracked by the user through various attributes for their character. Each choice can affect different attributes of their character, such as maximum health or strength.

My goal is to make this process as simple as creating a character in a video game. Video game developers have created a simple, guided process to create a character and start a game. The user will be presented with options at each step of the 9 step FAGE process. Options will include descriptions and what character attributes those options will affect, with the user seeing the attributes change as they progress through the 9 steps.

The final output will be a form-fillable PDF character sheet that can be printed or used digitally. These sheets are normally updated with notes such as equipment or inventory changes the character experiences through gameplay. Some players prefer to keep this digtitally, others prefer the paper and pencil route.

The app would also have the ability to save these characters, in order to "level up" their character. As they play, the character will gain experience and move up levels which in turn will earn them attribute advancements. The app will be able to import or load a character, guide the user through the leveling up process and present the various options which the new level warrants.

Usage rights: I have reached out to the publisher, Green Ronin to explain my project and ask for guidance on what my limits and boundaries are. They have assured me that I can use the contents of their book to build the app with no issues as long as I do not profit monetarilly from the app. My goal would be to share the app with the community for free use.

As far as I have researched, an application such as the one I have described does not exist for FAGE or any other AGE product. I only found character randomizers, which are not a good tool to create a character to play in a campaign. Randomizers are used mostly by game masters and writers to enrich their stories. I have found an example similar to what I want to create in the D&D Beyond character creator. https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters (account required to access).
